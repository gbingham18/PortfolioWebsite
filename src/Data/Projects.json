        "Type": "Capstone",
        "Image": "AFSdarkgrey",
        "Description": "A web application built on the Angular4 platform, Flask micro framework, and Python. The application was developed for the Whitworth Biology Department, and provides a graphical representation of the frequency of dominant alleles within populations. The algorithm is based on the Hardy-Weinberg equation and uses random pairing of parent alleles. Our team utilized agile methodologies for this capstone project.",
